* AkkaClusterScalaChat
It is a simple chat using Akka Cluster to p2p connection chat members.

This project was written to getting my first software engineer position. There are a lot of bugs but if you got a similar task you can use this project as a template to implementing your own.


Run project:
#+begin_src bash
./gradlew run
